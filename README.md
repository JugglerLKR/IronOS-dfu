# STM32F103C8 bootloader

Based on the awesome work by https://github.com/davidgfnet/stm32-dfu-bootloader
and huge kudos for the framework https://github.com/adamheinrich/cm-makefile

This is _going to be_ an alternative bootloader for the Miniware Irons.
THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY. DO NOT FLASH THIS YET.
